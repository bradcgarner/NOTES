  Etc.

How long have you been in web development?

What attributes do you look for when hiring junior developers?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Feedback and Advice Received @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Highlight my unique background
  Stormwater
  Earth sciences
  Business management / business process
  Long history of seeing a challenge and trying to tackle it, which was mostly outside of my primary role

Emphasize the quality of my new work (web development)
  Don't let my backstory / prior successes overshadow
  
Don't forget to read the audience
  If not able to research the audience in advance, include a little exploratory research early in the conversation

These two can be contradictory; balance them:
  Don't just say 'what' you did, say why you did it
    Show passion about your projects
    E.g. stormwater project, past experience, why it matters, what is unique
  Get to the point faster
    Explaining the 'why' and story can seem like avoiding discussion of technology used
    Discuss key technologies used and basic sequence/process for building with those technologies

What people look for:
  Personality
  Communication
  Ability to learn
  Breadth of knowledge / flexibility in learning
  Teamwork skills
  
What no-one expects
  Perfect portfolio
  Exact skills match
  Perfect command of each and every technology
  
Buzzwords that I tend to forget to use (even though they are implied)
  Communication
  Teamwork
  
Some things I should remember to include
  User feedback
